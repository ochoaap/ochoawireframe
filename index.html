            <p>Hercules, Achilles, Hektor, Paul Bunyon, John Henry, Robin Hood - these were all, and still are great heroes and mythology that is taught all around the world. 1939 was the first Superman comic, and he is often dubbed the "the first superhero". After him came a myriad of heroes from very well known heroes such as Batman to not so known heroes like the Big wheel. These are the modern day mythologies that I grew up with, as well as the old Greek Mythology. These beings are god-like, or like Thor, are actual gods taken from their own mythos and dropped into a new age of mythology. While I love the supervillians who make these superheoes so great. If it weren't for the superheroes themselves we wouldn't have this mythology that we see playing out in front of us on the big screen, books, comics, videogames and other media. So, here are my four favorite superheroes. Click the links above to find out more information about them, and I hope you have a great day, and remember like Stan Lee always said: Excelsior!!! </p>
